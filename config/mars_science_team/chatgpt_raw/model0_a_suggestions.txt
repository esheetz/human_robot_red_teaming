Your current model captures a basic sequence of sample collection, analysis, and reporting but could be improved to reflect the complexities of a Mars surface mission. Here are some suggestions:

### **1. Expanding State Representation**
Your states are too limited to account for real-world challenges like environmental hazards, communication delays, or the need for coordination among robots. Consider adding:
- **robot_available** (to reflect if the robot is free for new tasks)
- **robot_needs_recharge** (to ensure energy levels are considered)
- **communication_delayed** (to reflect when Earth communication is out of sync)
- **sample_type_identified** (since not all samples may be relevant for analysis)
- **sample_contaminated** (to model errors in collection)

### **2. Refining Actions**
Your actions should account for additional operational concerns, such as:
- **scan_for_samples**: A pre-step before detection.
  - *Preconditions:* [robot_available]
  - *Postconditions:* [sample_detected]
- **transmit_findings**: A separate step from reporting to address time delays.
  - *Preconditions:* [findings_ready, communication_delayed]
  - *Postconditions:* []
- **coordinate_with_other_robots**: Since multiple robots are involved.
  - *Preconditions:* [robot_available]
  - *Postconditions:* [task_synchronized]

### **3. Handling Time-Delayed Communication**
- Introduce a **delayed_response** state that captures when commands from Earth are in transit.
- Modify actions so that critical updates (e.g., report_findings) cannot be executed unless communication is available.

Would you like me to update your YAML model with these refinements?
