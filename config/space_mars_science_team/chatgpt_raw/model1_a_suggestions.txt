Your updated model is well-structured, but there are a few areas for improvement and further refinement to enhance safety, autonomy, and operational efficiency.

### **Suggested Improvements:**
#### **1. Additional States for Better Coverage**
- **robot_moving** – To indicate when the robot is navigating to prevent task overlap.
- **robot_stuck** – To handle situations where the robot encounters an obstacle and needs assistance or re-planning.
- **power_low** – To model power constraints, ensuring the robot prioritizes recharging.
- **mission_interrupted** – To represent scenarios where tasks must be paused due to unforeseen issues (e.g., severe dust storms, critical system failures).

#### **2. Refining Actions for Realistic Execution**
- **navigate_to_sample** – The robot should explicitly move to the sample location before picking it up.
  - *Preconditions:* [robot_available]
  - *Postconditions:* [robot_moving]
- **recharge_robot** – Ensures power management.
  - *Preconditions:* [power_low]
  - *Postconditions:* [robot_available]
- **self_recover** – A self-recovery action if the robot becomes stuck.
  - *Preconditions:* [robot_stuck]
  - *Postconditions:* [robot_available]
- **pause_mission** – If an emergency occurs, the robot should stop ongoing actions and wait for further instructions.
  - *Preconditions:* [emergency_detected]
  - *Postconditions:* [mission_interrupted]

#### **3. Handling Multi-Robot Coordination**
- **sync_with_team** – Establishes a state where multiple robots confirm task synchronization.
  - *Preconditions:* [task_synchronized]
  - *Postconditions:* []

Would you like me to update your YAML model to reflect these refinements?
