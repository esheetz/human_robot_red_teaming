Your model is already quite comprehensive, but I suggest considering the following refinements to further enhance its robustness:

### **1. Additional States to Improve Situational Awareness**
- **weather_hazard_detected** – Represents when adverse weather (e.g., dust storm) impacts operations.
- **robot_damaged** – Indicates if the robot has sustained damage, affecting mobility or functionality.
- **communication_blackout** – A critical state where no communication is possible with either ground control or other robots.
- **critical_system_failure** – Represents a major failure requiring human intervention or a last-resort autonomous recovery attempt.

### **2. New Actions for Operational Flexibility**
- **detect_weather_hazard**
  - *Preconditions:* [robot_available]
  - *Postconditions:* [weather_hazard_detected]

- **assess_damage**
  - *Preconditions:* [robot_available, robot_damaged]
  - *Postconditions:* [failure_reported]

- **attempt_autonomous_repair**
  - *Preconditions:* [robot_damaged]
  - *Postconditions:* [robot_available] (if successful), [critical_system_failure] (if unsuccessful)

- **safe_mode_activation**
  - *Preconditions:* [critical_system_failure]
  - *Postconditions:* [mission_interrupted]

Would you like me to update your YAML model with these enhancements?
