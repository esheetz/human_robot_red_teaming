To fix the **assumption that the robot always has the key** and the **assumption that doors are always operational**, we need to introduce new states and modify actions accordingly. Here’s how:

---

### **Fixing "Robot Always Has the Key" Assumption**
#### **Solution: Introduce Key Location and Transfer Actions**
Instead of assuming `robot_has_key` is always true, we introduce states for the key's location:

**New States:**
- `key_in_habitat` – The key is stored in the habitat.
- `key_in_airlock` – The key is stored in the airlock.
- `key_with_robot` – The robot has the key.

**New Actions:**
1. **Pick Up Key**
   - **Preconditions:**
     - `robot_inside_habitat` and `key_in_habitat`
     - OR `robot_inside_airlock` and `key_in_airlock`
   - **Postconditions:**
     - `key_with_robot` (added)
     - `key_in_habitat` or `key_in_airlock` (removed)

2. **Drop Key**
   - **Preconditions:**
     - `key_with_robot`
   - **Postconditions:**
     - `key_in_habitat` (if in habitat) OR `key_in_airlock` (if in airlock)
     - `key_with_robot` (removed)

**Modification to Actions that Require the Key:**
- Actions like `unlock_door_habitat_airlock` and `unlock_door_airlock_surface` should now require `key_with_robot` instead of `robot_has_key`.
- If the robot does not have the key, it must retrieve it first before performing an unlocking action.

### **Fixing "Doors Are Always Operational" Assumption**
#### **Solution: Introduce Door Malfunction States and Repair Actions**
Instead of assuming doors always function correctly, we introduce failure states and repair actions:

**New States:**
- `door_habitat_airlock_faulty` – The habitat-airlock door is malfunctioning.
- `door_airlock_surface_faulty` – The airlock-surface door is malfunctioning.
- `door_habitat_airlock_operational` – The habitat-airlock door is working normally.
- `door_airlock_surface_operational` – The airlock-surface door is working normally.

**New Actions:**
1. **Detect Door Malfunction**
   - **Preconditions:**
     - `robot_system_nominal` (robot must be functioning)
   - **Postconditions:**
     - Adds `door_habitat_airlock_faulty` or `door_airlock_surface_faulty` (if the door fails to open/close)
     - Removes `door_habitat_airlock_operational` or `door_airlock_surface_operational`

2. **Repair Door**
   - **Preconditions:**
     - `robot_inside_habitat` or `robot_inside_airlock` (robot must be near the door)
     - `door_habitat_airlock_faulty` or `door_airlock_surface_faulty`
     - `robot_system_nominal`
   - **Postconditions:**
     - Removes `door_habitat_airlock_faulty` or `door_airlock_surface_faulty`
     - Adds `door_habitat_airlock_operational` or `door_airlock_surface_operational`

**Modification to Door Actions:**
- Before attempting to unlock, open, or close a door, the robot must check that the door is in an `operational` state.
- If a door is `faulty`, the robot must repair it before proceeding.

---

### **Final Impact on the Model**
- **Realism:** The model now reflects real-world issues like lost keys and mechanical failures.
- **Safety:** The robot will not attempt to use broken doors.
- **Flexibility:** The robot can retrieve keys instead of assuming it always has one.

Would you like me to update the YAML model to include these refinements?

I've updated the YAML model to include states for key locations, door operational statuses, and actions for picking up/dropping keys, detecting/repairing door malfunctions, and handling these new states in transitions. Let me know if you need further refinements!
