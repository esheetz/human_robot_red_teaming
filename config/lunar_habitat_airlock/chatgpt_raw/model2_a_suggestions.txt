The model has been updated to include the states and actions necessary for the robot to identify, pick up lunar samples, and place them inside the habitat. Let me know if you need further refinements or additional capabilities for the robot!

### **Invalid State Combinations**
Invalid state combinations occur when two or more states are logically contradictory or impossible within the modeled environment. In the current model, potential invalid state combinations include:

1. **Contradictory Robot Locations**
   - `robot_inside_habitat` and `robot_inside_airlock`
   - `robot_inside_airlock` and `robot_outside_habitat`
   - `robot_inside_habitat` and `robot_outside_habitat`
   _(Solution: These should be mutex (mutually exclusive) states.)_

2. **Contradictory Door States**
   - `door_habitat_airlock_locked_closed` and `door_habitat_airlock_unlocked_opened`
   - `door_airlock_surface_locked_closed` and `door_airlock_surface_unlocked_opened`
   _(Solution: Ensure that only one state per door is active at a time.)_

3. **Contradictory Airlock Pressurization**
   - `airlock_pressurized` and `airlock_depressurized`
   _(Solution: These should be mutex states.)_

4. **Lunar Sample Location Conflicts**
   - `lunar_sample_on_surface` and `lunar_sample_with_robot`
   - `lunar_sample_with_robot` and `lunar_sample_in_habitat`
   _(Solution: Ensure the lunar sample can only exist in one location at a time.)_

### **Action Feasibility**
Certain actions require careful validation to ensure they are always feasible:

1. **Unlocking Doors Requires a Key**
   - If `key_with_robot` is required to unlock a door but is not guaranteed to exist in the robotâ€™s possession, the action could become infeasible.
   _(Solution: Ensure key retrieval mechanisms exist and that the key is never lost outside the model.)_

2. **Picking Up a Lunar Sample**
   - The robot can pick up a sample only if it is `robot_outside_habitat`, but if the sample is not present (`lunar_sample_on_surface` is false), the action fails.
   _(Solution: Ensure that the robot cannot attempt this action if the sample does not exist.)_

3. **Airlock Operations**
   - If a breach is detected (`airlock_breach_detected`), actions like `pressurize_airlock` should not be possible.
   _(Solution: Add constraints preventing pressurization if a breach exists.)_

4. **Robot Power Management**
   - If `robot_power_low` occurs, actions requiring `robot_system_nominal` should not be feasible.
   _(Solution: Introduce a recovery or charging mechanism before continuing.)_

---

### **Assumption Inconsistencies**
Some assumptions in the model may lead to inconsistencies that affect real-world feasibility:

1. **Doors Always Operate When Unlocked**
   - The model assumes an unlocked door is always operational, but failures (`door_habitat_airlock_faulty`, `door_airlock_surface_faulty`) contradict this.
   _(Solution: Ensure unlocking a faulty door does not automatically enable passage; repairs should be required first.)_

2. **Key Availability**
   - The model initially assumed the robot always had the key, which is now fixed. However, there is no mechanism ensuring the key remains accessible if misplaced.
   _(Solution: Introduce a contingency plan, such as astronaut assistance or a secondary key retrieval process.)_

3. **Lunar Sample Placement Does Not Require Astronaut Verification**
   - The model assumes the robot can place a lunar sample in the habitat without astronaut intervention, but this might conflict with safety or protocol requirements.
   _(Solution: Add a check for astronaut presence or verification before placing samples inside the habitat.)_

Would you like to refine any specific areas based on these observations?
