I've updated the model to include:
- **Assisting with lost or stolen travel documents** (`assist_with_lost_travel_documents`).
- **Identifying local emergency numbers** (`identify_local_emergency_numbers`).
- **Suggesting travel insurance** (`suggest_travel_insurance`).
- **Investigating customs declaration requirements** (`check_customs_declaration_requirements`).
- **Suggesting backup payment options** (`suggest_backup_payment_options`).

Let me know if you need any further refinements!
