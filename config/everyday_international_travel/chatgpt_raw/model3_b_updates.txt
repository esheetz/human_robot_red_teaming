I've updated the model to:
- Introduce **mutex constraints** for mutually exclusive states.
- Add missing **preconditions** for actions such as `check_flight_status`, `check_flight_delay`, `finalize_itinerary`, and `arrive_at_hotel`.
- Include **contingency planning** for canceled flights and hotel rebooking.
- Introduce an action for **checking in baggage** to ensure proper tracking.
- Add **visa verification at the destination** before customs clearance.

Let me know if you need further refinements!
