I've updated the model to include:
- **Handling of connecting flights and layovers** (`layover_required`, `human_in_layover`, `layover_completed`).
- **Weather impact on flight status** (`weather_impact_assessed`).
- **Validation of medical requirements before travel** (`medical_requirements_validated`).
- **Updated action preconditions** for better feasibility and logical execution.

Let me know if you need any further refinements!
