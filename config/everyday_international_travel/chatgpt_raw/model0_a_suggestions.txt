Your current model covers the basic steps of getting from home to an international destination, but it lacks several critical aspects necessary for a robust travel-planning assistant. Here are key improvements:

### **1. Missing States**
Your state list is quite limited. Here are important states to add:
- **travel_documentation_ready** (e.g., passport, visa)
- **transportation_arranged** (e.g., ride-share, taxi to the airport)
- **baggage_packed**
- **security_cleared** (after airport security check)
- **customs_cleared** (after international arrival)
- **human_at_hotel** (for tracking travel progress)
- **human_experiencing_travel_issue** (for handling problems)

### **2. Missing Actions**
Your current actions assume a smooth journey. Here are essential actions:
- **prepare_travel_documents** (ensures visa, passport are valid)
- **pack_baggage** (ensures luggage is ready)
- **book_transportation** (ensures a ride to the airport)
- **check_in_for_flight** (online or at the airport)
- **clear_security** (precondition: human_at_airport)
- **clear_customs** (precondition: human_at_destination)
- **handle_travel_issue** (adaptive response to disruptions)

### **3. Error Handling & Adaptability**
Your model assumes perfect conditions. Add states and actions to manage:
- **Flight delays/cancellations** → Modify **take_flight** to check for updated flight status.
- **Lost luggage** → Introduce state **baggage_lost** and an action **report_lost_luggage**.
- **Missed flights** → Add action **rebook_flight**.

Would you like me to refine this YAML file for you with these updates?
