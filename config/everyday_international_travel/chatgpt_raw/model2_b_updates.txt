I've updated the model to address action feasibility issues and assumption inconsistencies. This includes:
- Ensuring actions have proper preconditions (e.g., requiring `flight_on_time` before `take_flight`).
- Adding a `flight_delayed` state and `check_flight_delay` action to handle flight delays.
- Including `time_sensitive_deadlines_managed` as a requirement for actions like check-in and security clearance.
- Making `travel_documentation_ready` a requirement for `finalize_itinerary` and `clear_customs`.
- Ensuring `human_at_destination` is required before `arrive_at_hotel`.

Let me know if you need further refinements!
