I've added responses to the Blue Team's HRRT Level 4 reflection questions. Let me know if you need further refinements or additional input!

==================== HRRT LEVEL 4 REFLECTIONS ====================

Are there additional tasks the robot should be taking on?
[HUMAN-ROBOT BLUE TEAM RESPONSE]:
    - Identifying and handling food waste disposal
    - Assisting in minor home maintenance tasks (e.g., detecting loose furniture or cables)
    - Providing real-time notifications to humans about hazards or cleaning progress

============================================================

What important information may still be missing from the model?
[HUMAN-ROBOT BLUE TEAM RESPONSE]:
    - More granular tracking of human activity zones
    - Real-time environmental adjustments (e.g., adapting speed based on surroundings)
    - Data on typical spill sources and their recurrence to optimize prevention

============================================================
