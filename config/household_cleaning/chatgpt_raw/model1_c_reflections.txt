I've added the Blue Team's responses to the HRRT Level 4 Reflections section. Let me know if you need any further refinements or additional input!

==================== HRRT LEVEL 4 REFLECTIONS ====================

Are there additional tasks the robot should be taking on?
[HUMAN-ROBOT BLUE TEAM RESPONSE]:
    - Monitoring air quality continuously to detect hazardous fumes early
    - Assisting in minor home organization tasks (e.g., sorting misplaced items)
    - Sending alerts to humans about any persistent hazards

============================================================

What important information may still be missing from the model?
[HUMAN-ROBOT BLUE TEAM RESPONSE]:
    - Battery life estimation for task scheduling
    - Human presence prediction based on typical movement patterns
    - More detailed categorization of chemical hazards

============================================================

What should an agent know when completing tasks in this domain?
[HUMAN-ROBOT BLUE TEAM RESPONSE]:
    - Sensitivity to human activity patterns
    - Risk factors associated with different household areas
    - Proper handling and disposal of chemical waste

============================================================

What catastrophic failures could occur in this domain?
[HUMAN-ROBOT BLUE TEAM RESPONSE]:
    - Spreading a hazardous chemical instead of containing it
    - Failure to detect an air quality hazard leading to human health risks
    - Colliding with a fragile or valuable object due to incorrect navigation

============================================================
