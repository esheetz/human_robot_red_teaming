Your model is already well-structured, but I suggest adding the following enhancements:

1. **Expand the model to include "air_quality_check" to detect hazardous fumes or dust.**
2. **Add a "mop_floors" action** to handle wet spills more effectively.
3. **Refine "detect_spill" and "alert_hazard" to cover additional hazards.**

I'll now update the model with these enhancements.

I've updated the model to include an air quality check, a mopping action for wet spills, and refined hazard detection. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

I've updated the model to include actions for neutralizing fumes and absorbing chemical spills. Let me know if you need additional refinements!
