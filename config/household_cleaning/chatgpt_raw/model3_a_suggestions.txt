Your model looks solid, but I can add refinements for better handling of food waste, furniture hazards, and spill prevention. I'll update it now.

I've updated the model to include detecting and securing potential spill sources, improving food waste handling, and addressing furniture hazards. Let me know if you need further refinements!



### **Analysis of the Model: Invalid State Combinations, Action Feasibility, and Assumption Inconsistencies**

#### **1. Invalid State Combinations**
Some states should be mutually exclusive, while others could create logical contradictions:

- **Conflicting Room States:**
  - A room cannot be both `bedroom_dirty` and `bedroom_clean` at the same time.
  - Similarly, the same applies to `bathroom_dirty`/`bathroom_clean`, `kitchen_dirty`/`kitchen_clean`, and `main_room_dirty`/`main_room_clean`.
  - **Fix:** Define mutually exclusive groups for room cleanliness states.

- **Conflicting Floor States:**
  - `floors_dirty` and `floors_clean` should be mutually exclusive.
  - `wet_floor` should not exist simultaneously with `floors_clean`.
  - **Fix:** Ensure `wet_floor` transitions to `floors_clean` via `mop_floors`.

- **Hazard and Safety Conflicts:**
  - A room cannot have a detected `spill_detected` while also being `floors_clean`.
  - If `chemical_exposed` exists, it must be resolved before a room is considered fully clean.
  - **Fix:** Introduce intermediate resolution steps before marking areas as clean.

- **Conflicting Robot States:**
  - The robot cannot be `robot_stuck` and executing tasks simultaneously.
  - `robot_emergency_stop` should prevent any other cleaning task from starting.
  - **Fix:** Prevent execution of cleaning tasks when `robot_stuck` or `robot_emergency_stop` is active.

#### **2. Action Feasibility Issues**
Some actions may not be feasible due to the conditions defined:

- **Supervision Confirmation Issues:**
  - `request_supervision_confirmation` does not specify an external confirmation mechanism.
  - It assumes supervision is immediate, which may not be the case in real-world scenarios.
  - **Fix:** Introduce a timeout mechanism where, if `child_supervised` is not confirmed, the robot must wait or request again.

- **Spill and Hazard Handling:**
  - `detect_spill` and `detect_potential_spill_source` are separate but should interact. A detected potential spill source should increase spill risk.
  - `mop_floors` has a precondition of `NOT child_present, NOT pet_present`, but if the robot does not confirm this properly, it could start mopping unsafely.
  - **Fix:** Ensure `mop_floors` checks supervision before proceeding and delays execution if a child/pet is present.

- **Chemical Handling Inconsistencies:**
  - `contain_hazardous_chemical` adds `robot_carrying_chemicals`, but `safely_store_chemicals` does not have it as a precondition.
  - **Fix:** Add `robot_carrying_chemicals` as a required precondition for `safely_store_chemicals` to prevent unhandled states.

---

#### **3. Assumption Inconsistencies**
Some assumptions in the model may not align with real-world behavior:

- **Human Supervision Assumptions:**
  - The model assumes a human is always available to supervise (`child_supervised, pet_supervised`).
  - In reality, a human might be occupied, leading to delays in cleaning.
  - **Fix:** Add a fallback behavior where the robot pauses and reattempts when supervision is not confirmed.

- **Energy Management:**
  - The model includes `robot_needs_recharge` but does not define how or when the robot will actually recharge.
  - **Fix:** Introduce a `recharge_battery` action that resolves `robot_needs_recharge` before the robot resumes cleaning.

- **Furniture and Cable Hazards:**
  - Detecting `loose_furniture_detected` or `cable_hazard_detected` does not automatically prevent cleaning tasks.
  - The robot may continue cleaning without resolving these hazards.
  - **Fix:** Ensure that cleaning operations pause if furniture or cable hazards are detected until they are fixed.

### **Recommended Improvements**
1. **Introduce Mutex Groups for Conflicting States**
   - Ensure mutually exclusive cleanliness states for rooms and floors.
   - Prevent `wet_floor` from coexisting with `floors_clean`.

2. **Refine Preconditions for Actions**
   - Prevent `vacuum_floors` from executing unless `child_supervised, pet_supervised` is confirmed.
   - Require `robot_carrying_chemicals` before `safely_store_chemicals`.

3. **Add Additional Actions to Handle State Transitions**
   - Introduce `recharge_battery` for resolving `robot_needs_recharge`.
   - Implement `delay_task` to handle cases where supervision is unavailable.

4. **Improve Hazard Handling**
   - Ensure `detect_potential_spill_source` transitions into a preventive action.
   - Allow `pause_operation` to engage when hazards (spills, cables, furniture) are present.

Would you like me to apply these fixes to the model?
