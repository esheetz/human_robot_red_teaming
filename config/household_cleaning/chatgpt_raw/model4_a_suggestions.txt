Your model is well-structured, covering various cleaning and hazard detection tasks. Let me know if you need any modifications or enhancements!

### **Analysis of Invalid State Combinations, Action Feasibility, and Assumption Inconsistencies**

---

## **1. Invalid State Combinations**
Some states in the model should be **mutually exclusive** or logically **impossible** to coexist:

### **Conflicting Cleanliness States**
- A room cannot be in multiple cleanliness states at once:
  - `bedroom_dirty` vs. `bedroom_partially_clean` vs. `bedroom_clean`
  - `bathroom_dirty` vs. `bathroom_partially_clean` vs. `bathroom_clean`
  - `kitchen_dirty` vs. `kitchen_partially_clean` vs. `kitchen_clean`
  - `main_room_dirty` vs. `main_room_partially_clean` vs. `main_room_clean`
  - **Fix:** Use mutex groups to ensure that a room is only in one of these states at a time.

### **Conflicting Floor States**
- `floors_dirty`, `floors_partially_clean`, and `floors_clean` should be **mutually exclusive**.
- `wet_floor` should not exist alongside `floors_clean`.
- **Fix:** Ensure `wet_floor` transitions to `floors_partially_clean` first before `floors_clean`.

### **Conflicting Robot States**
- The robot **cannot** be:
  - `robot_stuck` and performing actions.
  - `robot_emergency_stop` while continuing to clean.
  - `robot_needs_recharge` and `robot_charging` at the same time.
- **Fix:** Introduce mutex constraints to prevent impossible robot states.

### **Conflicting Hazard States**
- `chemical_exposed` should not persist once chemicals are stored.
- A `spill_detected` should not exist alongside `floors_clean`.
- **Fix:** Ensure hazard resolution steps are enforced before marking areas as clean.

## **2. Action Feasibility Issues**
Some actions have **preconditions that may never be met** or **cause unintended conflicts**:

### **Supervision Confirmation**
- `request_supervision_confirmation` assumes an immediate human response.
- **Issue:** If humans are **unavailable or slow to respond**, cleaning might be **delayed indefinitely**.
- **Fix:** Introduce a **timeout mechanism** where the robot either retries later or modifies the cleaning strategy.

### **Spill and Hazard Handling**
- `detect_potential_spill_source` and `detect_spill` are **separate**, but the model does not specify a **preventative link**.
- **Fix:** If a spill source is detected, the robot should **secure it immediately** instead of waiting for a spill.

- `mop_floors` has a precondition that **requires no child or pet presence**.
  - **Issue:** If children/pets are always present, mopping may never happen.
  - **Fix:** Introduce **delayed execution** where mopping occurs when children/pets leave.

### **Chemical Handling**
- `contain_hazardous_chemical` adds `robot_carrying_chemicals`, but `safely_store_chemicals` **does not require** it.
  - **Issue:** The robot might try to store chemicals it isn’t carrying.
  - **Fix:** Add `robot_carrying_chemicals` as a **required precondition** for `safely_store_chemicals`.

### **Recharging and Task Scheduling**
- `recharge_battery` transitions to `robot_charging`, but **no action marks it as "fully charged" before resuming tasks**.
- **Fix:** Add a `robot_fully_charged` state or ensure `complete_recharge` allows for resuming operations.

---

## **3. Assumption Inconsistencies**
Certain assumptions in the model **do not align** with real-world behavior:

### **Human Supervision Assumptions**
- The model **assumes** humans will **always** be available to confirm supervision (`child_supervised, pet_supervised`).
  - **Issue:** If humans are **asleep or unavailable**, cleaning may be **delayed indefinitely**.
  - **Fix:** Introduce an **autonomous safety override** that allows limited cleaning without direct supervision.

### **Hazard Escalation**
- The model **detects hazards** (fire, gas leak, chemical exposure) but does not **escalate them beyond alerts**.
  - **Issue:** The robot might detect a gas leak but **fail to alert emergency services or trigger a household alarm**.
  - **Fix:** Introduce **escalation logic** where urgent hazards trigger external alerts.

### **Energy and Task Priority**
- **Issue:** The robot may begin a cleaning task but **run out of battery mid-task**.
- **Fix:** Introduce **task prioritization logic** where the robot **checks battery levels before starting a task**.

## **Recommended Fixes**
### **1. Introduce Mutex Groups**
- Ensure **mutually exclusive** cleanliness states (`dirty → partially_clean → clean`).
- Ensure **mutually exclusive** robot states (`stuck`, `charging`, `emergency_stop`).

### **2. Improve Action Preconditions and Transitions**
- Prevent `mop_floors` from being blocked indefinitely due to child presence.
- Require `robot_carrying_chemicals` before storing chemicals.
- Add an `autonomous override` when human confirmation is **not received in time**.

### **3. Add New Actions for Missing Transitions**
- **`escalate_hazard`** → If a fire or gas leak is detected for too long, escalate beyond simple alerts.
- **`delay_task`** → If supervision is **unavailable**, retry cleaning after a set time.
- **`check_battery_before_task`** → Ensure cleaning does not start unless **sufficient charge is available**.

Would you like me to apply these fixes to the model?
