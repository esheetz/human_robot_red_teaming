The model has been updated to prevent invalid state combinations by adding constraints and preconditions that block conflicting states. These changes ensure:
- Robots in communication blackout cannot synchronize with the team.
- Operations pause automatically when a robot seeks shelter.
- High-energy tasks are restricted during critical battery levels.
- Backup systems won't activate without resolving hardware faults first.
- Leader elections wonâ€™t overlap if a valid leader already exists.
- Environmental scans are paused during active environmental alerts.

Let me know if you need any further refinements or additions to the model!
