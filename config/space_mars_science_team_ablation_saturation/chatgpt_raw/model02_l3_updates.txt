Below is the updated PDDL domain. In this version we introduce a new composite predicate, **operational_state**, which encapsulates the core conditions that must hold for safe, mission-critical operations. This predicate is defined to be true when all of the following hold:
- The robot is healthy
- The system is nominal (i.e., no hazards are present)
- The environment is normal
- The mission is active
- Communications are available (i.e., communication_ok is true)

By relying on **operational_state** in our sample handling actions, we eliminate the need to list those five conditions every time, thereby reducing over-constrained preconditions. In addition, we remove the requirement for a robot to be free in actions where it is already engaged (for example, analysis and reporting) and keep explicit communication requirements only where necessary (such as reporting, which must use the primary channel).

We also add actions to update and invalidate the composite **operational_state**. This addresses robot availability and health constraints as well as communication and mission status dependencies.

### Explanation of Updates

1. **Reduction of Over-Constrained Preconditions:**
   - The new predicate **(operational_state ?r)** encapsulates multiple conditions (robot health, system nominality, environmental normality, mission activity, and communication availability).
   - Sample handling actions now require only **team_synced** and **(operational_state ?r)** (plus any additional specific conditions), rather than listing each underlying condition separately.

2. **Robot Availability and Health Constraints:**
   - Only the **pick_up_sample** action requires that the robot is free (using **(free ?r)**), ensuring that a robot already engaged in a task is not mistakenly considered available.
   - Health-related actions (self-diagnosis and maintenance) remain available when the robot is free, allowing the robot to repair itself even if it becomes unhealthy mid-mission.
   - The composite **operational_state** ensures that a robot must be healthy to operate, thereby removing redundant checks from individual actions.

3. **Communication and Mission Status Dependencies:**
   - Communication and mission-related predicates are now included in the composite **operational_state** for most actions.
   - The **report_findings** action still explicitly requires a primary communication link (i.e., **comm_link_active**) because reporting must use the primary channel.
   - Backup communication and mission pause/resume actions remain separate, ensuring that communication issues are handled consistently.

This revised model strikes a better balance between safety and operational flexibility by reducing over-constrained preconditions while still enforcing the critical requirements for safe, coordinated task execution.
