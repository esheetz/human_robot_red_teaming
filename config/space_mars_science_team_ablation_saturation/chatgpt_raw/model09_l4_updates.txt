The model has been updated to incorporate:
- **Predictive fault detection** for early detection of potential failures.
- **Redundancy system activation** to proactively address detected faults.
- **Retry limits** and fallback mechanisms for hardware failures.
- **Energy conservation and redistribution checks** based on energy thresholds.

These additions enhance fault detection, energy management, and redundancy measures to mitigate risks effectively. Let me know if any further adjustments are needed!
