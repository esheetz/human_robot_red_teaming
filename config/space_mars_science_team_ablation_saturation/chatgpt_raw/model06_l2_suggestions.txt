Below are some examples of invalid state combinations that—while our revised model has improved safeguards—may still occur transiently or due to asynchrony, even though they ideally should not:

- **Safe Mode and Grace Period Coexistence:**
  A robot might briefly have both *(safe_mode ?r)* and *(grace_period_active ?r)* true. Ideally, entering safe mode should preclude the grace period state, but delays in state updates could result in both being active concurrently.

- **Operational State with Outdated Conditions:**
  The composite *(operational_state ?r)* predicate is meant to require that all underlying conditions (e.g., communication, sensor normals, gc_status_updated) are met. However, if one of these conditions (like *(communication_ok)* or *(gc_status_updated)*) fails and the corresponding invalidation action has not yet executed, the robot may temporarily retain *(operational_state ?r)* even though one or more required conditions are now false.

- **Overlapping Log States:**
  There could be a transient state where a diagnostic log is marked as both sent *(diagnostic_log_sent ?r)* and buffered *(buffered_diagnostic_log ?r)* if the retry mechanism has been initiated but not yet completed. This overlap should not occur but might briefly happen due to asynchronous log handling.

- **Conflicting Communication Channel States:**
  Although our model attempts to switch to primary communication and deactivate backup channels, there might be a window where *(comm_link_active)* is true and one or more backup channels (e.g., *(backup_comm_active2)*) remain active before the transition is complete.

- **Emergency Reboot Overlap:**
  If the *emergency_reboot* action is triggered while the robot is still marked as being in safe mode or within a grace period, there may be a brief overlap where the robot’s internal state is being reset but the *(safe_mode ?r)* predicate has not yet been cleared.

- **Stale Shared Status:**
  Even though there is an action to retract shared status when safe mode is active, a robot’s status *(status_shared ?r)* might remain visible for a short time after entering safe mode, potentially misleading other agents until the retraction action completes.

These transient or asynchronous state overlaps are inherent in complex, distributed systems and highlight the challenge of ensuring perfect consistency in real-world operations.
