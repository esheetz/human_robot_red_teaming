Below is the updated PDDL domain that incorporates multiple samples, explicit team coordination, and built‐in safety rules. In this version:

- **Multiple Samples:**
  Sample‐related predicates (such as detection, analysis, and findings) now take a sample parameter. A robot’s possession of a sample is tracked with a predicate parameterized by both the robot and the sample. We also add a predicate `(free ?r)` to indicate that a robot is available to pick up a new sample.

- **Team Coordination:**
  The predicate `(team_synced)` is required as a precondition for sample handling actions. Two actions—`sync_team` and `unsync_team`—are added to model team coordination, with synchronization assumed to occur over an active communications link.

- **Safety Conditions:**
  The global predicates `(system_nominal)` and `(hazard_detected)` are now managed by two actions: `detect_hazard` (which marks a hazard and removes the nominal status) and `clear_hazard` (which restores a nominal system state once hazards are cleared). In addition, sample-related actions require the system to be nominal and free of hazards.

Below is the complete updated model:

```

### Explanation

- **Multiple Samples:**
  Each sample is uniquely identified, and the predicates ensure that the robot’s interaction with samples is managed on a per-sample basis. The `(free ?r)` predicate guarantees that a robot can handle only one sample at a time.

- **Team Coordination:**
  Actions such as picking up, analyzing, and reporting a sample all require that the team is synchronized (i.e. `(team_synced)` is true). The `sync_team` action provides a mechanism to establish that synchronization, assuming an active communication link.

- **Safety Conditions:**
  The `detect_hazard` and `clear_hazard` actions allow the model to enforce that `(system_nominal)` and `(hazard_detected)` remain mutually exclusive. All sample-related actions require the system to be nominal and free of hazards.

This updated model better reflects a complex operational environment where multiple samples, coordinated teamwork, and dynamic safety conditions must be managed reliably.
