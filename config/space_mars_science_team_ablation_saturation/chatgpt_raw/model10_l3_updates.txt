The model has been updated to address action feasibility and assumption inconsistencies by:
- Allowing redundancy activation when a predictive fault is detected.
- Preventing energy redistribution during communication blackouts.
- Allowing critical tasks to proceed during environmental alerts.
- Requiring verification of leader status before initiating fallback elections.
- Blocking diagnostics if energy levels are insufficient.
- Enforcing team resynchronization after communication blackout recovery.
- Preventing environmental scans when energy levels are critically low.

Let me know if any further improvements or refinements are needed!
