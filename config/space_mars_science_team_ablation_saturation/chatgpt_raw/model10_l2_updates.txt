I've updated the model to include constraints that prevent the previously identified invalid state combinations. These additions ensure:
- Redundancy systems only activate after predictive fault detection.
- Team synchronization is invalidated during communication blackouts.
- Energy redistribution is blocked if the donor robot's energy falls below the minimum threshold.
- Operational state deactivates during environmental alerts.
- Diagnostics and redundancy systems require a detected fault before activation.
- Fallback leader elections wonâ€™t initiate if a leader already exists.

Let me know if there are further adjustments or refinements you need!
