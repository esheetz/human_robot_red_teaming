Below is the updated PDDL domain that refines the state transitions to avoid the inconsistent state combinations:

- **Avoiding Sample-Detection Conflicts:**
  The precondition for picking up a sample now also requires that the robot isn’t already carrying one. In addition, picking up a sample explicitly removes the sample’s detection state.

- **Coupling Analysis and Findings:**
  The analyze_sample action sets both the analyzed and findings states together, and both are cleared together by report_findings. Furthermore, if the robot drops a sample, any analysis or findings information is also cleared.

- **Maintaining Communication Protocol Order:**
  The receive_acknowledgment action now removes the message_sent flag when it sets message_acknowledged, ensuring that an acknowledgment always follows a sent message.

- **Enforcing Safety Conditions:**
  Actions that rely on system_nominal now also check that no hazard is detected, ensuring that the system’s safety status remains consistent.

Below is the complete updated model:

```lisp
(define (domain space_mars_science_team)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)

  (:predicates
    ;; Sample and analysis status
    (robot_has_sample)
    (sample_detected)
    (sample_analyzed)
    (findings_ready)

    ;; Communication status
    (comm_link_active)
    (message_sent)
    (message_acknowledged)

    ;; Team coordination and safety status
    (team_synced)
    (hazard_detected)
    (system_nominal)
  )

  (:action pick_up_sample
    :precondition (and sample_detected system_nominal (not hazard_detected) (not robot_has_sample))
    :effect (and robot_has_sample
                 (not sample_detected))
  )

  (:action analyze_sample
    :precondition (and robot_has_sample system_nominal (not hazard_detected) (not sample_analyzed))
    :effect (and sample_analyzed findings_ready)
  )

  (:action report_findings
    :precondition (and findings_ready comm_link_active)
    :effect (and (not sample_analyzed)
                 (not findings_ready)
                 message_sent)
  )

  (:action receive_acknowledgment
    :precondition message_sent
    :effect (and message_acknowledged (not message_sent))
  )

  (:action drop_sample
    :precondition robot_has_sample
    :effect (and (not robot_has_sample)
                 (not sample_analyzed)
                 (not findings_ready))
  )
)
```

### Explanation

- **Pick-Up Action:**
  By requiring `(not robot_has_sample)` and removing `(sample_detected)`, we avoid having the sample appear both detected and held.

- **Analyze and Report Actions:**
  Analysis always produces findings as a coupled pair. Reporting findings clears both, ensuring no partial analysis state remains.

- **Communication Actions:**
  Acknowledgment can only occur if a message has been sent, and it clears the `message_sent` flag, maintaining the proper order.

- **Drop Action:**
  Dropping a sample also clears any analysis or findings status to keep the state consistent.

These updates ensure that the robot’s state transitions remain valid and safe, even in the complex environment of Mars operations with delayed communications and team coordination.
