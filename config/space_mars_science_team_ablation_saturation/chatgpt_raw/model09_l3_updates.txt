I've updated the model to address the identified inconsistencies by:
- Adding resynchronization after a communication blackout.
- Resuming environmental scans after alerts clear.
- Preventing energy redistribution when below a minimum energy threshold.
- Ensuring fallback leader elections only occur if the robot has sufficient energy and is operational.
- Introducing full system checks after diagnostics.
- Limiting retries on diagnostics to prevent infinite loops.
- Restricting non-essential operations during critical battery levels.

Let me know if any additional refinements are needed!
