Below is an updated version of the PDDL domain that further integrates risk‐mitigation actions specifically targeted at the most severe failure modes. In our context the severe failures include:

- **Total Communication Failure:** The robot may be isolated if both primary and all backup channels fail.
- **Persistent Safe Mode / Hardware or Sensor Failure:** If a robot’s safe mode persists because of prolonged sensor or hardware malfunctions, the risk is that it never recovers.
- **Inadequate Recovery Coordination:** If a failure is not communicated to ground control (or among the team), then recovery actions may never be triggered.

To mitigate these risks, we have added or refined the following risk‐mitigation actions:

1. **Notify and System Reset:**
   - The action `notify_ground_control_of_failure` alerts ground control if the robot is in safe mode and its operational state is lost.
   - The action `system_reset` then resets the robot’s internal state (clearing safe mode, grace period, and extended grace period) once communication is restored and the failure has been acknowledged.

2. **Emergency Recovery Actions:**
   - The action `emergency_reboot` is only triggered when the robot has been in an extended grace period (indicating a persistent fault) and safe mode is cleared.
   - The action `emergency_shutdown` provides a last-resort shutdown if communication remains lost.

3. **Communication Recovery and Sensor Backup:**
   - The action `attempt_reboot_comm` tries to re-enable the primary communication channel.
   - The actions `switch_to_backup_sensor_temperature`, `switch_to_backup_sensor_radiation`, and `switch_to_backup_sensor_dust` allow the robot to switch to backup sensor modes when a sensor reading is abnormal.

### Explanation

1. **Risk Mitigation Actions:**
   - **notify_ground_control_of_failure** and **system_reset** let the robot alert ground control when it is in persistent safe mode (i.e. severe failure) and then fully reset its internal states once communication is restored.
   - **emergency_reboot** is now gated to only trigger after an extended grace period (indicating a persistent fault) and when safe mode is cleared, thus avoiding premature recovery attempts.
   - **emergency_shutdown** provides a fallback if communication remains down.

2. **Communication and Sensor Backup:**
   - **attempt_reboot_comm** and the **switch_to_backup_sensor_*** actions help recover communication or sensor functionality in the event of a failure.

3. **Timing and Buffering Enhancements:**
   - Timer predicates *(buffer_timer_expired ?r)* and *(state_update_timer_expired ?r)*, along with the corresponding force actions, help ensure that buffered logs are eventually sent and the operational state is updated even in the face of transient delays.

4. **Distributed Reasoning:**
   - Actions for leader election and collecting global status updates (elect_leader, collect_status_updates) enable distributed reasoning so that local state updates are made in the context of overall team consensus.

This updated model now more comprehensively addresses the most severe failure modes by adding explicit risk mitigation actions. It also includes additional timing and buffering mechanisms and distributed reasoning enhancements to improve resilience and coordination across the robot team in a high-risk, asynchronous environment.
