The model has been updated to include:
- **Sensor recalibration** actions for detecting and correcting sensor faults.
- **Team synchronization enforcement** to maintain alignment after communication blackouts.
- Additional failure mitigation actions, including proactive recalibration and synchronization mechanisms.

Let me know if any further adjustments or enhancements are needed!
