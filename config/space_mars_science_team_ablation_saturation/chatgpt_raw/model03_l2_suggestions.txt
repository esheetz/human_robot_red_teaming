Below are some examples of invalid state combinations in the revised model—states that should never simultaneously hold because they contradict the intended safety or operational logic:

1. **Safety and System Conditions:**
   - **(system_nominal)** and **(hazard_detected):**
     The model is designed so that when a hazard is detected, the system is no longer nominal. If both predicates are true at once, it creates ambiguity about the safety of operations.

2. **Environmental Conditions vs. Operational State:**
   - **(operational_state ?r)** is defined to require that **(temperature_normal)**, **(radiation_normal)**, and **(dust_normal)** all hold. If any one of these environmental predicates is false while **(operational_state ?r)** is still true, the robot is assumed to be operating under safe conditions when it is not.
   - Similarly, if **(environment_verified)** is false (meaning ground control has not confirmed safe environmental readings) yet the system continues to operate as if conditions are safe, that is an inconsistency.

3. **Communication Status Inconsistencies:**
   - A robot should not have **(communication_ok)** true if neither **(comm_link_active)** nor **(backup_comm_active)** holds. In other words, if all communication channels are down, **(communication_ok)** must be false.
   - The reporting cycle should ensure that **(message_sent ?r)** is cleared once **(message_acknowledged ?r)** is set. Having both true or an acknowledgment without a prior message indicates a breakdown in the communication protocol.

4. **Robot Availability and Sample Handling:**
   - A robot cannot simultaneously be **(free ?r)** and hold a sample via **(has_sample ?r ?s)**. Once a sample is picked up, the robot’s availability flag should be removed.
   - Additionally, if **(sample_detected ?s)** is still true while **(has_sample ?r ?s)** is also true, it implies that the same sample is both uncollected (detected in the environment) and already in possession, which is contradictory.

5. **Robot Health, Calibration, and Resource Status:**
   - The composite **(operational_state ?r)** requires that the robot is healthy, calibrated, and has sufficient resources. If any of these conditions (e.g., **(robot_healthy ?r)**, **(calibrated ?r)**, or **(sufficient_resources ?r)**) is false while **(operational_state ?r)** remains true, that is an invalid combination.
   - Such inconsistencies would allow a robot to undertake mission-critical actions despite being unfit or under-resourced.

6. **Analysis and Findings Consistency:**
   - The model couples **(sample_analyzed ?s)** with **(findings_ready ?r ?s)** during analysis. If one is true without the other, it suggests an incomplete or inconsistent analysis process.
   - Similarly, if a sample has been verified by ground control (via **(sample_verified ?r ?s)**) without proper analysis or if it’s verified when the sample is no longer in the correct state (e.g., after being dropped), that state combination would be logically inconsistent.

In summary, the model is structured to prevent these contradictory states by ensuring that:
- Safety predicates are mutually exclusive.
- The composite **operational_state** reflects a holistic set of necessary conditions.
- Communication, robot availability, and sample status are managed such that a robot is never marked as both free and busy or as operating under safe conditions when key metrics indicate otherwise.

These invalid state combinations, if present, would signal an error in state transition management or a failure in external updates, and they must be detected and resolved to ensure mission safety.
