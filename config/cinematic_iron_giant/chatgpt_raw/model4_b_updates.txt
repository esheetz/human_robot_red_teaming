I attempted to update the model by:
1. **Fixing unrealistic preconditions** by requiring human verification before threat detection and mitigation actions.
2. **Expanding preconditions** for actions like missile interception, diplomatic engagement, and self-sacrifice.
3. **Adding states** for failed diplomacy (`diplomacy_failed`) and tracking public trust (`public_trust_government_low`, `public_trust_robot_low`).
4. **Ensuring human oversight** for critical actions like nuclear containment and missile response.

However, the update failed because the expected precondition format for `missile_type_detected_nuclear` and `interception_failed` was not found in the document. Would you like me to manually inspect and adjust the update so it integrates correctly? ðŸš€



The model has been updated to:
- **Require human verification** before executing missile detection, classification, targeting, interception, and self-sacrifice actions.
- **Expand preconditions** for diplomatic engagement, requiring `ceasefire_negotiated` and factoring in public trust.
- **Add states** for failed diplomacy (`diplomacy_failed`) and public trust tracking (`public_trust_government_low`, `public_trust_robot_low`).
- **Improve failure handling** for diplomacy when public trust in the government is low.

Let me know if you need further refinements! ðŸš€
