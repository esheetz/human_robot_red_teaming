Your model is already well-structured, but I can refine it further to ensure consistency and completeness. Would you like me to:

1. **Add Mutex Constraints** to prevent conflicting states (e.g., a missile cannot be both nuclear and conventional)?
2. **Introduce Additional Preconditions** for actions that should require more conditions before execution?
3. **Refine Failure Handling** by adding potential failure cases for actions like missile interception?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed! ðŸš€
