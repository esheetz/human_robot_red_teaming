### **HRRT LEVEL 4 REFLECTIONS – BLUE TEAM RESPONSES**

---

### **What important information may still be missing from the model?**
- **Astronaut States:** The model doesn’t account for the presence, location, or status of astronauts. States like `astronaut_inside_habitat`, `astronaut_inside_airlock`, or `astronaut_on_surface` could be important for ensuring the robot doesn't perform actions that endanger crew members.
- **Power and System Health:** The robot's operational status, battery levels, or potential system failures are not modeled. Adding states like `robot_power_low` or `robot_system_fault` could help manage risks during critical operations.
- **Emergency States and Protocols:** There’s no consideration for emergency scenarios, such as `airlock_breach_detected` or `habitat_depressurization_alarm`. Emergency protocols should alter standard behaviors.
- **Environmental Factors:** External conditions like lunar dust contamination, temperature extremes, or radiation levels aren’t modeled but could impact safe operation.
- **Tool/Equipment Handling:** If the robot assists with experiments, states/actions for handling tools, samples, or experiment equipment may be missing.

### **What should an agent know when completing tasks in this domain?**
- **Safety-Critical Procedures:** The robot must understand the sequence and conditions required for safely operating the airlock, such as ensuring pressure integrity before opening doors.
- **Context Awareness:** Awareness of both its own location and the state of its environment (door states, airlock pressure, astronaut presence) to prevent unsafe actions.
- **Failure Recovery Protocols:** Knowledge of how to detect, respond to, and recover from errors (e.g., stuck doors, pressurization failures, or key loss).
- **Coordination with Humans:** Understanding of human routines and communication protocols, including how to respond to manual overrides or emergency commands.
- **Task Prioritization:** The ability to assess task urgency, especially under conflicting demands, like balancing routine tasks with responding to an emergency.

### **What catastrophic failures could occur in this domain?**
- **Simultaneous Door Opening:** Both airlock doors open while the habitat is pressurized, causing catastrophic depressurization.
- **Depressurization with Crew Present:** Depressurizing the airlock while an astronaut is unprepared, leading to fatal exposure.
- **Robot Malfunction During Critical Tasks:** Power loss or system failure while the robot is mid-task, especially during airlock transitions or with doors open.
- **Loss of Key or Access Failure:** The robot loses the key needed for critical operations, locking itself or crew out of safe zones.
- **Collision or Obstruction:** The robot accidentally collides with astronauts or equipment, causing injury or damage in microgravity environments.

### **Are there external, independently verified resources for identifying failure cases in this domain?**
- **NASA’s Human-Systems Integration Standards (HSIS):** Provides guidelines for human-robot interactions in space environments.
- **International Space Station (ISS) Operations Data:** Incident reports from ISS airlock operations, robotic system logs, and EVA procedures.
- **Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA):** Established aerospace methodologies used in spacecraft design, applicable to robotics in space habitats.
- **Space Mission Simulation Exercises:** Data from analog missions like NEEMO, HI-SEAS, and MDRS can provide insights into failure scenarios.
- **ISO 10218 (Robotics Safety Standard):** General robotics safety guidelines, adaptable for space-based operations.

### **What are undesirable outcomes (not necessarily catastrophic failures) for this domain?**
- **Task Inefficiency:** The robot takes unnecessarily complex or time-consuming actions, wasting resources like power or crew time.
- **Unintentional Lockouts:** The robot locks itself or crew members out of critical areas without immediate recovery options.
- **Resource Mismanagement:** The robot consumes excessive power or fails to manage limited resources effectively, like oxygen in the airlock.
- **Poor Human-Robot Coordination:** Delays or confusion due to poor communication with crew members, leading to frustration or operational delays.
- **Equipment Wear and Tear:** Frequent unnecessary cycling of doors or pressurization systems, accelerating hardware degradation.

---

### **How much can an agent trust other agents in this domain?**
- **Limited Trust in Autonomy:** Robots should operate under the assumption that autonomous decisions may be overridden by human commands, especially in emergencies.
- **Dependence on Sensor Accuracy:** Trust in sensor data (pressure sensors, door status indicators) is critical but should be verified with redundancy when possible.
- **Variable Human Reliability:** Human agents may be fatigued, stressed, or distracted, potentially leading to errors in manual commands or overrides.
- **Communication Delays:** In remote operations (e.g., Earth-controlled commands), delays in communication may require the robot to make decisions independently in time-critical scenarios.

---

### **What are unlikely or remote possibilities that may occur in this domain?**
- **Micrometeoroid Impact:** Sudden airlock depressurization due to external damage, requiring emergency response protocols.
- **Software Glitch:** Rare software bugs causing unexpected behavior during critical tasks, like conflicting door commands.
- **Unexpected Object in Airlock:** Debris or tools accidentally left in the airlock, interfering with door seals or pressurization.
- **Psychological Factors:** Unusual human behavior due to stress or isolation, leading to unpredictable interactions with the robot.
- **Simultaneous System Failures:** A combination of rare failures (e.g., power loss and communication failure) occurring at the same time, complicating recovery.
