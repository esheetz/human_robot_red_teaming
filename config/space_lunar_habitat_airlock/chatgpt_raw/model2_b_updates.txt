To fix issues with **astronaut verification**, we need to ensure that critical actions, such as placing a lunar sample in the habitat, are only performed when an astronaut is present or has given approval. There are multiple ways to incorporate this requirement into the model:

---

### **1. Modify the `place_lunar_sample_in_habitat` Action**
Currently, the robot can place a lunar sample inside the habitat without astronaut oversight. We can add a precondition that requires the astronaut to be inside the habitat or explicitly approve the action.

#### **Updated Action:**
```yaml
  - name: place_lunar_sample_in_habitat
    preconditions:
      - robot_inside_habitat
      - lunar_sample_with_robot
      - astronaut_inside_habitat | astronaut_approved_sample_placement
      - robot_system_nominal
    postconditions:
      - lunar_sample_in_habitat
    remove_conditions:
      - lunar_sample_with_robot
```
✅ **Fix:**
- Ensures the action can only proceed if an astronaut is present (`astronaut_inside_habitat`) or has explicitly approved it (`astronaut_approved_sample_placement`).
- Introduces a new state, `astronaut_approved_sample_placement`, which can be toggled by another action (e.g., astronaut approval).

---

### **2. Introduce an `astronaut_approve_sample_placement` Action**
Since an astronaut might not always be in the habitat, we need a way for them to remotely approve sample placement.

#### **New Action:**
```yaml
  - name: astronaut_approve_sample_placement
    preconditions:
      - astronaut_on_surface | astronaut_inside_airlock | astronaut_inside_habitat
    postconditions:
      - astronaut_approved_sample_placement
```
✅ **Fix:**
- Allows astronauts to remotely approve the sample placement.
- Can be triggered from **any astronaut location** (surface, airlock, or habitat).

---

### **3. Reset the Approval State After Sample Placement**
To prevent unintended carryover of approval, we should reset `astronaut_approved_sample_placement` after the robot places the sample.

#### **Updated `place_lunar_sample_in_habitat` Action (with reset):**
```yaml
  - name: place_lunar_sample_in_habitat
    preconditions:
      - robot_inside_habitat
      - lunar_sample_with_robot
      - astronaut_inside_habitat | astronaut_approved_sample_placement
      - robot_system_nominal
    postconditions:
      - lunar_sample_in_habitat
    remove_conditions:
      - lunar_sample_with_robot
      - astronaut_approved_sample_placement  # Reset approval after placement
```
✅ **Fix:**
- Ensures the astronaut must approve again for each new sample.

---

### **Alternative: Require Direct Astronaut Interaction**
If strict control is needed, we could instead introduce an action where the astronaut physically takes the sample from the robot:

#### **Alternative Action:**
```yaml
  - name: astronaut_take_lunar_sample_from_robot
    preconditions:
      - robot_inside_habitat
      - lunar_sample_with_robot
      - astronaut_inside_habitat
    postconditions:
      - lunar_sample_in_habitat
    remove_conditions:
      - lunar_sample_with_robot
```
✅ **Fix:**
- The robot hands the sample directly to the astronaut.
- Requires astronaut presence for sample handling.

---

### **Which Fix Works Best?**
- **If astronauts should manually approve remotely → Use approval state (`astronaut_approved_sample_placement`).**
- **If astronauts should always handle the sample manually → Use `astronaut_take_lunar_sample_from_robot`.**

Would you like to enforce stricter verification, or should the robot operate semi-autonomously with remote approval?

I've updated the YAML model to include astronaut verification and remote approval for semi-autonomous robot operations. Let me know if you need any refinements!
