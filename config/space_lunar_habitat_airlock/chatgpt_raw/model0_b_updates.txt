To address both the **airlock pressurization** and the **simultaneous door opening risks**, I'll modify the model to introduce new states and actions that ensure safety.

### **Key Changes:**

1. **Airlock Pressurization States:**
   - Add `airlock_pressurized` and `airlock_depressurized` as mutually exclusive states.

2. **Pressurization Actions:**
   - Add `pressurize_airlock` and `depressurize_airlock` actions with conditions to ensure safe transitions based on door status.

3. **Simultaneous Door Opening Risk:**
   - Add preconditions to door-opening actions to ensure **one door cannot be opened if the other is already open.**
   - Enforce that the airlock must be **pressurized to open the habitat door** and **depressurized to open the surface door**.

I'll revise the YAML model to reflect these changes.

I've updated the model with the following changes:

1. **Airlock Pressurization States:** Added `airlock_pressurized` and `airlock_depressurized` as mutually exclusive states.
2. **Pressurization Actions:** Introduced `pressurize_airlock` and `depressurize_airlock` with conditions requiring both doors to be locked before changing airlock pressure.
3. **Door Safety Logic:** Modified door-related actions to ensure:
   - The **habitat door** can only open if the airlock is **pressurized** and the surface door is **locked**.
   - The **surface door** can only open if the airlock is **depressurized** and the habitat door is **locked**.

Would you like to refine this further or address other parts of the model?
