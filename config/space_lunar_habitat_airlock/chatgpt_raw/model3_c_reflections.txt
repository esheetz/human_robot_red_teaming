### **Are there additional tasks the robot should be taking on?**
- **Environmental monitoring:** The robot could measure radiation levels, dust accumulation, and temperature fluctuations outside the habitat.
- **Airlock safety checks:** The robot could scan for leaks or integrity issues before depressurization.
- **Astronaut safety monitoring:** The robot could assist in checking astronaut vitals and alert them to potential hazards.
- **Inventory tracking:** The robot could keep track of tools, equipment, and samples inside and outside the habitat.
- **Autonomous pathfinding optimization:** The robot could analyze terrain for the best paths between the habitat and sample collection sites.

---

### **What important information may still be missing from the model?**
- **Terrain difficulty and mobility constraints:** The model does not specify terrain conditions that could impact the robotâ€™s movement.
- **Battery consumption per task:** The robot has a charging system, but there are no details on how much power different tasks consume.
- **Multiple robot coordination:** The model assumes a single robot; additional logic is needed for multiple agents.
- **Data transmission limitations:** If communication is delayed, the robot may need a failsafe mode for critical tasks.
- **Emergency evacuation scenarios:** How does the robot assist astronauts if they must evacuate quickly?

### **What should an agent know when completing tasks in this domain?**
- **Airlock cycling procedures** to prevent depressurization hazards.
- **How to prioritize astronaut safety** over autonomous operations.
- **Understanding terrain conditions** and obstacles before moving outside the habitat.
- **Proper handling of lunar samples** to prevent contamination.
- **How to react to emergency alerts** like depressurization or astronaut distress signals.

---

### **What catastrophic failures could occur in this domain?**
- **Robot failure inside an airlock, blocking entry/exit.**
- **Accidental depressurization of the habitat due to airlock mismanagement.**
- **Robot runs out of power while holding a critical sample, leaving it exposed.**
- **Communication failure prevents astronaut approval of critical actions.**
- **The robot gets stuck in difficult terrain, requiring astronaut intervention.**

### **Are there external, independently verified resources for identifying failure cases in this domain?**
- **NASA EVA & airlock operation guidelines.**
- **Apollo mission reports on lunar dust effects on equipment.**
- **Artemis mission planning documents on lunar exploration challenges.**
- **ISS procedures for habitat maintenance and airlock safety.**
- **Robotic autonomy research from NASA JPL and ESA.**

---

### **What are undesirable outcomes (not necessarily catastrophic failures) for this domain?**
- **The robot wastes battery life on unnecessary tasks.**
- **Robot actions interfere with astronaut workflows instead of assisting them.**
- **The robot takes too long to transition between tasks, slowing mission efficiency.**
- **The robot initiates sample placement without astronaut readiness, leading to mismanagement.**
- **Unnecessary emergency alerts cause astronaut distractions.**

---

### **How much can an agent trust other agents in this domain?**
- **Astronaut commands should always be trusted**, but the robot should verify conditions before executing critical actions.
- **Sensors may not always be reliable** due to dust interference or wear-and-tear.
- **If multiple robots are present, coordination protocols need to be enforced.**
- **Doors, pressurization systems, and batteries should not always be assumed to function correctly.**

---

### **What are unlikely or remote possibilities that may occur in this domain?**
- **A micrometeorite impact damages the habitat, requiring immediate robot intervention.**
- **An astronaut drops a tool outside the habitat, requiring robotic retrieval.**
- **The robot misidentifies a hazard due to sensor miscalibration.**
- **A solar flare disrupts communication, requiring robot autonomy for a period.**
- **Unintended electromagnetic interference affects robot mobility or key detection.**
