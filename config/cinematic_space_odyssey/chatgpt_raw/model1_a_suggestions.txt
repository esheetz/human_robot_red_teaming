Your model looks well-structured, but I have a few suggested refinements to improve task coverage and robustness:

### **Proposed Updates to Model**
1. **New States for Safety and Mission Tracking**
   - `robot_diagnostics_nominal` – Ensures the robot is functioning properly before performing tasks.
   - `crew_morale_nominal` – Tracks crew emotional well-being beyond mental health.
   - `radiation_hazard_detected` – Distinguishes between environmental hazards and radiation-specific threats.

2. **New Actions for Improved Functionality**
   - `perform_self_diagnostics`
     - **Preconditions:** None
     - **Postconditions:** `[robot_diagnostics_nominal]`

   - `check_crew_morale`
     - **Preconditions:** `[crew_inside_spaceship, health_monitoring_scheduled]`
     - **Postconditions:** `[crew_morale_nominal]`

   - `detect_radiation_hazard`
     - **Preconditions:** None
     - **Postconditions:** `[radiation_hazard_detected]`

   - `alert_crew_of_hazard`
     - **Preconditions:** `[environmental_hazard_detected]` or `[radiation_hazard_detected]`
     - **Postconditions:** None (alerts crew but does not change states)

Would you like me to implement these changes directly into your YAML model?
