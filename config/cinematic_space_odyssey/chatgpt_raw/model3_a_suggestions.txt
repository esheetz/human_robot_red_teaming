The model is now robust, incorporating hazard response tracking, communication to ground control, and the ability for crew and ground control to override the system. Let me know if you need any further refinements or additions!



### **Analysis of Invalid State Combinations, Action Feasibility, and Assumption Inconsistencies**

#### **1. Invalid State Combinations**
Some state combinations are contradictory and should be made mutually exclusive:
- **Airlock Pressurization Conflicts**
  - `airlock_depressurized` and `airlock_pressurized` should **never be true at the same time**.
  - Crew movement actions should ensure that transitioning between these states happens correctly.

- **Crew Location Conflicts**
  - `crew_inside_spaceship` and `crew_outside_spaceship` **should never be active together**.
  - If `crew_outside_spaceship` is true, all `crew_location_*` states should be false.

- **Mission Phase Conflicts**
  - `mission_phase_prelaunch`, `mission_phase_surface_exploration`, and `mission_phase_return` should be **mutually exclusive**.

- **Life Support Conflicts**
  - `life_support_nominal` and `life_support_failure_detected` should **never be true at the same time**.

- **Override Conflicts**
  - `crew_override_active` and `ground_control_override_active` **should not be active at the same time** unless thereâ€™s a specific reason for both overrides being enabled.

---

#### **2. Action Feasibility Issues**
Some actions are missing necessary preconditions, making them potentially unsafe or ineffective.

- **`transport_crew_to_destination`**
  - Requires `crew_inside_spaceship`, but does **not check if the airlock is pressurized after transport**.
  - Add **postcondition**: `airlock_pressurized` after successful crew transport to prevent accidental decompression.

- **`resolve_emergency`**
  - Resolves `crew_emergency_detected`, but **does not ensure that medical intervention was successful**.
  - Should include a verification step before removing `crew_emergency_detected`.

- **`perform_autonomous_repairs`**
  - Assumes that any `systems_malfunction_detected` can be repaired without assessing **the type of malfunction**.
  - Introduce **failure types** (e.g., `power_system_failure_detected`, `communication_failure_detected`) to differentiate between issues the robot can fix vs. those requiring human intervention.

- **`verify_action_success`**
  - Requires `human_verification_received` but **does not track what is being verified**.
  - Should include an explicit verification target (e.g., `crew_transport_verified`, `hazard_mitigation_verified`).

---

#### **3. Assumption Inconsistencies**
Some model assumptions could lead to logical inconsistencies or unexpected behaviors.

- **Robot Diagnostics and Self-Repairs**
  - The model assumes `robot_diagnostics_nominal` can be determined by a single action (`perform_self_diagnostics`).
  - However, `perform_self_diagnostics` does not account for **partial failures** (e.g., a damaged sensor that does not fully disable the robot).
  - Introduce `robot_partial_malfunction_detected` to allow for **gradual degradation** rather than binary functioning vs. failure.

- **Hazard Communication and Response**
  - `alert_crew_of_hazard` and `communicate_hazard_to_ground_control` are separate actions, but **hazard mitigation is not explicitly tracked**.
  - Add `hazard_mitigation_successful` to ensure hazards are being addressed.

- **Override Handling**
  - `crew_override_active` and `ground_control_override_active` allow for manual intervention but **do not specify priority**.
  - Define a rule for **which override takes precedence** if both are activated.

---

### **Recommended Fixes**
1. **Make Conflicting States Mutually Exclusive**
   - Ensure `airlock_depressurized` and `airlock_pressurized` cannot be active together.
   - `crew_inside_spaceship` and `crew_outside_spaceship` should be **mutex** states.
   - `life_support_nominal` and `life_support_failure_detected` should never be true at the same time.

2. **Introduce Additional Preconditions and Postconditions**
   - `transport_crew_to_destination` should **pressurize the airlock after transport**.
   - `resolve_emergency` should require `medical_intervention_verified` before removing `crew_emergency_detected`.
   - `perform_autonomous_repairs` should differentiate between fixable and non-fixable failures.

3. **Improve Verification and Tracking**
   - `verify_action_success` should have **specific verification types** to track different successful actions.
   - Introduce `hazard_mitigation_successful` to confirm hazard resolution.

Would you like me to implement these fixes into the model?
