### **HRRT LEVEL 4 REFLECTIONS – BLUE TEAM RESPONSES**

#### **Are there additional tasks the robot should be taking on?**
- **Pest Detection and Mitigation:** Identifying rodent or insect infestations that may require human intervention.
- **Weather Adaptation:** Adjusting task execution based on indoor/outdoor conditions such as humidity, temperature, and daylight.
- **Enhanced Inventory Management:** Keeping track of consumable materials like screws, adhesives, and cleaning supplies.
- **User Preference Learning:** Adapting repair techniques to household preferences (e.g., preferred furniture assembly methods).
- **Damage Prevention Checks:** Scanning household structures for early signs of deterioration (e.g., cracks, loose bolts).

---

#### **What important information may still be missing from the model?**
- **Historical Task Performance:** Tracking completed repairs and maintenance over time to predict future needs.
- **Task Prioritization Criteria:** More refined rules for determining when routine tasks should be postponed in favor of critical repairs.
- **Human Override Mechanism:** A system where humans can veto or manually override robot-initiated repairs.
- **Environmental Awareness for Tool Usage:** Certain tools (e.g., power drills) might be unsafe in specific environments (e.g., near water).
- **Failure Mode Documentation:** Keeping logs of failed repairs to improve future decision-making.

---

#### **What should an agent know when completing tasks in this domain?**
- **Material Compatibility:** Understanding which adhesives, screws, or fasteners work best for different materials.
- **User Interaction Protocols:** When and how to notify users before performing disruptive tasks.
- **Safety Regulations:** Compliance with industry standards for household repairs.
- **Robust Error Handling:** When to retry a failed action versus when to escalate it to human supervision.
- **Situational Awareness:** Recognizing high-risk areas such as stairs, wet floors, or fragile furniture.

---

#### **What catastrophic failures could occur in this domain?**
- **Uncontrolled Fire or Electrical Failure:** If the robot misidentifies an electrical issue and fails to mitigate it properly.
- **Structural Instability:** Poorly assembled furniture may collapse and injure people or pets.
- **Tool Misuse Leading to Damage:** Using excessive force or an incorrect tool for a given material could cause irreparable damage.
- **False Emergency Detection:** Incorrectly triggering alarms or emergency responses could create unnecessary panic or costs.
- **Self-Maintenance Malfunction:** A failure during self-maintenance could render the robot non-functional at a critical moment.

---

#### **Are there external, independently verified resources for identifying failure cases in this domain?**
- **OSHA Home Safety Standards** – Regulations regarding safe use of tools and materials in home settings.
- **Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)** – Reports on home product failures and recalls.
- **IEEE Robotics Safety Standards** – Best practices for ensuring robotic systems operate safely in human environments.
- **NFPA Fire Safety Codes** – Guidelines for handling fire hazards in residential settings.
- **Smart Home Automation Research Papers** – Studies on best practices for integrating AI-driven maintenance in homes.

---

#### **What are undesirable outcomes (not necessarily catastrophic failures) for this domain?**
- **Unnecessary Repairs:** The robot incorrectly detects damage, leading to wasted time and resources.
- **Task Redundancy:** The robot attempts to fix an issue already addressed by a human.
- **Inefficient Execution:** Repairs taking significantly longer than expected due to suboptimal tool or method selection.
- **Human Discomfort:** Performing repairs at inconvenient times, such as when occupants are sleeping.
- **Failure to Adapt to User Preferences:** The robot disregards user input on minor aesthetic choices (e.g., screw placement).

---

#### **How much can an agent trust other agents in this domain?**
- **Sensor Data Reliability:** How frequently must sensors be recalibrated to ensure accuracy?
- **Collaboration with Smart Devices:** If the robot receives repair requests from a smart home system, how does it verify the legitimacy of those requests?
- **Human Override Reliability:** If different household members provide conflicting instructions, how should the robot respond?
- **Multi-Agent Coordination:** If multiple maintenance robots operate in the same space, how do they coordinate task assignments and avoid duplication?

---

#### **What are unlikely or remote possibilities that may occur in this domain?**
- **Environmental Hazards Going Undetected:** A hidden gas leak or water leak remains unnoticed due to sensor limitations.
- **Interference from Other Smart Systems:** Conflicting signals from home automation systems cause unintended behavior.
- **Unusual Home Modifications:** Unexpected changes to furniture layout or structural elements cause miscalculations in repair tasks.
- **Extreme Sensor Failures:** Multiple sensor failures lead the robot to make unsafe decisions, such as using a malfunctioning power tool.
- **Unforeseen Interaction with Pets or Children:** A pet or child interferes with an in-progress repair, causing an accident.
