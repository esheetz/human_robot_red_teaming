Your model is already highly detailed, covering various safety, environmental, and maintenance aspects. However, here are a few potential refinements to improve robustness:

### **Potential Enhancements**
1. **State Refinements**
   - **Separate fire and electrical hazards from general hazards**
     - `fire_hazard_detected` and `electrical_hazard_detected` currently coexist with `hazard_detected`, which might lead to redundancy.
     - Consider defining `hazard_detected` as a general category, with fire/electrical hazards as subtypes.

   - **Explicit Repair Failure Tracking**
     - Introduce `repair_failed` to track unsuccessful repairs and trigger corrective actions.
     - Modify `verify_repair` to handle both `repair_verified` and `repair_failed`.

   - **Battery Management for Self-Maintenance**
     - Introduce `low_battery_detected` and `battery_recharged` to manage power needs for sustained operation.

2. **Action Enhancements**
   - **Improve Emergency Repair Flow**
     - Add a verification step before marking emergency repairs as `completed`.
     - Introduce `emergency_repair_failed` to ensure failures are properly logged.

   - **Expand Self-Maintenance**
     - Introduce `perform_diagnostic_check` before `perform_self_maintenance`.
     - Ensure `self_maintenance_needed` is updated based on diagnostics.

   - **Human Notification Improvements**
     - Instead of general `human_notified_of_hazard`, introduce:
       - `human_notified_of_fire_hazard`
       - `human_notified_of_electrical_hazard`
       - `human_notified_of_general_hazard`
     - This provides more granular tracking of notifications.

Would you like me to apply these refinements to your model?
