Your model has a solid foundation, but there are some areas for improvement to ensure the robot can perform maintenance tasks safely and effectively. Here are some recommendations:

### **1. Expanding States for More Robust Task Tracking**
Your state list covers basic conditions but lacks nuance for real-world maintenance tasks. Consider adding:
- **`furniture_partially_assembled`** – Some furniture assembly tasks might involve multiple steps.
- **`repair_in_progress`** – Helps differentiate between detection and completion.
- **`tools_incorrectly_used`** – Captures potential errors that might require corrective actions.
- **`hazard_detected`** – Addresses potential safety risks (e.g., electrical issues, unstable furniture).
- **`repair_verified`** – Ensures that repairs are inspected before being considered completed.

### **2. Refining Action Pre/Post Conditions**
Several actions could benefit from additional safety checks and logical refinements:

- **`assemble_furniture`**
  - **Preconditions:** Add `tools_acquired` if tools are needed for assembly.
  - **Postconditions:** Consider adding `furniture_partially_assembled` before reaching `furniture_assembled`.

- **`perform_repair`**
  - **Preconditions:** Include `repair_detected` and `tools_acquired`, but consider adding `hazard_detected` to trigger necessary safety measures.
  - **Postconditions:** Instead of directly achieving `repair_completed`, first transition through `repair_in_progress`.

- **`stow_tools`**
  - **Preconditions:** Ensure that no task requiring tools is still active (`repair_in_progress` should not be present).

- **New Action: `verify_repair`**
  - **Preconditions:** `repair_completed`
  - **Postconditions:** Adds `repair_verified` to confirm the task's success.

- **New Action: `detect_hazard`**
  - **Preconditions:** None
  - **Postconditions:** Adds `hazard_detected`, triggering additional safety measures.
