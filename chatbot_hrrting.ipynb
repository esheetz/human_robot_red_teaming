(N) – The key may not always be available to the robot.\n","robot_inside_airlock → unlock_open_door_airlock_surface: (Y) – The robot must enter the airlock first, which is generally achievable.\n","robot_has_key → unlock_open_door_airlock_surface: (N) – Similar to #2, the key’s availability is not guaranteed.\n","robot_inside_habitat → enter_airlock_from_habitat: (Y) – This is

this.\n","door_airlock_surface_locked_closed → enter_airlock_from_habitat: (Y) – This state is typically maintained before airlock entry for safety.\n","robot_inside_airlock → enter_surface_from_airlock: (Y) – The robot can achieve this if prior steps succeed.\n","door_airlock_surface_unlocked_opened → enter_surface_from_airlock: (N) – The door may fail to unlock or open.\n","door_habitat_airlock_locked_closed → enter_surface_from_airlock: (Y) – Locking the habitat door is standard protocol before this action.\n","robot_outside_habitat → enter_airlock_from_surface: (Y) – The robot can reach this state unless external obstructions occur.\n","door_airlock_surface_unlocked_opened → enter_airlock_from_surface: (N) – Similar risks to #9

enter_habitat_from_airlock: (Y) – Achievable if previous airlock operations are successful.\n","door_habitat_airlock_unlocked_opened → enter_habitat_from_airlock: (N) – Door mechanism issues could prevent this.\n","door_airlock_surface_locked_closed → enter_habitat_from_airlock: (Y) – This condition is controlled during airlock procedures.\n","door_habitat_airlock_unlocked_opened → lock_close_door_habitat_airlock: (N) – Door may fail to lock due to mechanical issues.\n","door_airlock_surface_unlocked_opened → lock_close_door_airlock_surface: (N) – Similar to #17, locking

undone after unlock_open_door_airlock_surface: (N) – Similar risk to #27. 29. robot_inside_habitat undone after enter_airlock_from_habitat: (Y) – The robot physically moves, making this state invalid. 30. robot_inside_airlock undone after enter_surface_from_airlock: (Y) – Movement ensures this state is left behind. 31. robot_outside_habitat undone after enter_airlock_from_surface: (Y) – The robot’s
