- [x] update model formatting with confidence score
- [x] save off hypothesis to YAML file

- [x] save updated knowledge base to YAML file
- [x] remove SAR code and SAR todos

ChatGPT Blue Team: accept input from ChatGPT and update models
- [x] modify printing and red teaming levels to accept ChatGPT inputs
- [x] additional functions for processing ChatGPT input from transcripts:
	- [x] HRRT2: possibility validity
	- [x] HRRT3: assumption validity
	- [x] HRRT4: KB reflections
	- [x] HRRT4: updated model YAML
- [x] seed several model problems
  - [x] space related applications
	  - [x] lunar habitat
		- [x] mars team at distance
	- [x] household related applications
	  - [x] cleaning
		- [x] assembly and repair tasks
	- [x] day-to-day applications
	  - [x] planning international travel
		- [x] diagnosing issue with vehicle
	- [x] cinematic applications
		- [x] 2001 Space Odyssey
		- [x] Iron Giant
- [x] several iterations of HRRTing levels for problems until ChatGPT doesn't provide sufficient info
	- [x] space related applications
		- [x] lunar habitat (iterations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		- [x] mars team at distance (iterations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
	- [x] household related applications
		- [x] cleaning (iterations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		- [x] assembly and repair tasks (iterations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
	- [x] day-to-day applications
		- [x] planning international travel (iterations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		- [x] diagnosing issue with vehicle (iterations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
	- [x] cinematic applications
		- [x] 2001 Space Odyssey (iterations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		- [x] Iron Giant (iterations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Model planning problems:
- [x] incorporate pyperplan
- [x] convert model files to STRIPS files
	- [x] consistent domain name across all models
	- [x] double check translation to PDDL; spot checking a few models looks good
	- [x] assume models are supersets of each other, so if ChatGPT removed something from one iteration to the next, include it
	- [x] space related applications
