# Notes on ChatGPT

## Features

- Good at brainstorming, consistently makes ~5 suggestions for each prompted question
- Good at working from very minimal model information to explore the complexity of the scenario
- _If given complete control over editing a model_, can update and edit live, which is convenient

## Challenges

- Provides feedback in very inconsistent formats, making processing by another automated chatbot incredibly difficult
- Frequently repeats itself
- Quickly reaches saturation in suggestions
- Can be slow
- Frequently undoes or overwrites its previous work, requiring human intervention to maintain consistent building of knowledge
    - This further exacerbated the model's tendency to repeat itself
    - Often the same adjustment needed to be prompted multiple times by human
- Good at high-level questions, struggles with low-level details or specificity
- Had a much easier time with more day-to-day scenarios (which makes sense, given what model was likely trained on)
